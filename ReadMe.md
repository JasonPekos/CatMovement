|        | Animation            | Movement of two cats. Improvements: pause too long, scale bar readability, different cats, no fading in trace                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Jen    | Home range           | Assess brownian bridge. If sampling rate of collars is sufficiently high, brownian bridge might not be necessary. (Paper used 95% aKDE using the CTTM package in program R to calculate home-range) *Instead of computing  home range, planning on using home range estiamtes from supplementery doc.* |
|        | Time tracking        | When are cats tracked by Country. Improvements: colour, order by country and then within country, tooltips?                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Jen    | Distance travelled   | Incorporate age, sex, reproductive status.

|        | Rare pairs           | Focus on rare pairs that interact, who they are and how they interact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|        | Hidden Markov Model  | Model on behaviours (sleeping, local movement, exploration).
