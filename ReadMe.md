|        | Animation            | Movement of two cats. Improvements: pause too long, scale bar readability, different cats, no fading in trace                                                                                       |
|        | Home range           | Assess brownian bridge. If sampling rate of collars is sufficiently high, brownian bridge might not be necessary. (Paper used 95% aKDE using the CTTM package in program R to calculate home-range) |
|        | Time tracking        | When are cats tracked by Country. Improvements: colour, order by country and then within country, tooltips?                                                                                         |
|        | Distance travelled   | Incorporate age, sex, reproductive status.                                                                                                                                                          |
|        | Rare pairs           | Focus on rare pairs that interact, who they are and how they interact.                                                                                                                              |
|        | Hidden Markov Model  | Model on behaviours (sleeping, local movement, exploration). Asses, out of scope.                                                                                                                   |
|        | Extreme cats         | Look at cats that travel unusual distances (48km)                                                                                                                                                   |
| Jen    | Day-night behaviour  | movement patterns, distance travelled? incorporate prey data?                                                                                                                                       |
|        | Habitat distinctions | Differences in movement by urban/rural (Paper used local population density to classify urban or rural, 369 people/km2 as a threshold)                                                              |
|        | Ecological impact    | prey data?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|        | Supplementary plots  | Plots that could potentially be improved upon from supplementary info from paper (Original Study\suppinfo.docx).                                                                                    |
