Pet cat dataset

Graphs:
1. Animated zoom in a small group see how they move together, with animated spatial plots
2. when tracked time points
3. (scatter plot)Range of area they traverse change from in city, to outside coutry, distance from city max range
4. density of travel, dBBMM dynamic brownian birdge movement model
5. time series with something
6. small graphic about pet names
Range of area they traverse change from in city, to outside coutry

Questions we are interested in 
1. range that they travel, how does that change based on location
2. neighbouring cat's interact spatially
3. patterns in which they travel, going in circles random
4. constraining landscape elemetns, streets etc. that determine where they travel
5. we could get temperature and combine it, 
6. seasonal patterns to travel
7. times leave their homes, when they are out
8. pet names - patterns
9. distance and time to estimate speeds
10. sleeping times? levels of activity during speicifc times
3. would be cool, mice, prey data
